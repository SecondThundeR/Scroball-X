## What happened?

Unfortunately, I am not an advanced Android developer and cannot support this project further. This project got its life only because of my enthusiasm and desire to change the design of the application itself, which I actually did. However, further support (including fixes and new functions) is not possible due to the lack of my skills in this area and I had to make such a decision as to close this repository and not update it again (In fact, this application saved me when I used Apple Music, but now using Spotify, I stopped using this app long ago)

## Hey, I liked your app and have some skills to continue your work. What can I do?

Great question. If you are an Android application developer and would like to somehow improve this project, or even further engage in it, you can safely fork this repository. Perhaps, if your work is worth it, you will receive an invite to contribute to this repository and I will open it. But that's a completely different story ...
